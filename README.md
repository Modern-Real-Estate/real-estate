  ## Nguồn cảm hứng để Win Nguyen triển khai dự án này !
    <i>Từ xa xưa trong quan niệm của người Việt ta thì việc “an cư lạc nghiệp” là rất quan trọng. Mua đất là đầu tư an toàn và chắc chắn nhất. Đất chẳng thể mất đi và cũng chẳng thể đẻ thêm nên nếu không tăng giá thì cũng giảm rủi ro về sau. Điều quan trọng, khi sở hữu nhà đất, bạn không lo lắng về việc mất tiền thuê nhà hàng tháng. Nhờ đó số tiền kiếm được sẽ dễ tích lũy để sử dụng cho nhu cầu sinh hoạt và kinh doanh hàng tháng. Ở những vùng nông thôn đang trong quá trình thay đổi cơ sở hạ tầng làm giá đất tăng nhanh chóng. Điều này làm cho các hộ gia đình trong khu quy hoạch nhanh chóng trở nên giàu có. Nhiều người có thể mua nhà, mua xe ngay sau khi bán đất. Không thiếu các câu chuyên trên báo chí người dân phất lên nhờ bán đất. Điều này khiến không chỉ người dân địa phương mà còn thu hút rất nhiều nhà đầu tư "săn đất". Ai cũng mong một ngày giá đất tăng mạnh để đổi đời. Hơn nữa cơn sốt bất động sản đang là xu thế của những quốc gia đang phát triển như Việt Nam...</i>
    ###  Và để nắm bắt điều đó Win Nguyen quyết định triển khai dự án này tạo ra một hệ thống quản lý mua bán cho thuê bất động sản với tên gọi Win Nguyen Company với SLOGAN: KHÁCH HÀNG LÀ NHẤT CHÚNG TÔI PHỤC VỤ BẰNG CẢ CON TIM :3

## Inspiration for Win Nguyen to Launch This Project !
    <i>From ancient times, the Vietnamese have held the belief that "settling down leads to career success." Buying land is considered the safest and most secure investment. Land cannot be lost or created, so if it doesn't appreciate, it at least reduces future risks. Importantly, when owning property, you don't worry about monthly rent expenses. This allows the money earned to be saved more easily for monthly living and business needs.
    In rural areas undergoing infrastructure changes, land prices are rising rapidly. This has made families in planned zones wealthy quickly. Many people can afford to buy houses and cars right after selling land. There are numerous stories in the media about people getting rich by selling land. This attracts not only local residents but also many investors looking for land. Everyone hopes for a day when land prices soar to transform their lives. Moreover, the real estate boom is a trend in developing countries like Vietnam.</i>
    
    ### To seize this opportunity, Win Nguyen decided to launch this project to create a real estate buying, selling, and rental management system named WinNguyen Company with the SLOGAN: CUSTOMERS FIRST, WE SERVE WITH OUR HEART :3
    Customers coming to Win Nguyen Company need not worry about procedures or special policies. They just need to have the intention to buy/rent property, and we will handle all the procedures from A to Z with the best customer care policies ! ♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤♡ ♥💕❤From: :3 Win Nguyen Company

## Business Logic of This Project
1/ Relationship of Customer <--> User</br>
<i>Customers come to the real estate brokerage company Win Nguyen Company for consultation on buying/renting a building.
Afterwards, the User (with the ADMIN/MANAGER role) will assign the customer to a few staff members (AssignmentCustomer) for assistance.
During the care process, these staff members will make some transactions such as Deposit, Consultation Session, Order Confirmation (when the customer confirms the order, a Contract will be initiated), the reason for recording this information in detail is to track history and to fairly compensate the staff when the customer completes the order. For example, with the Transaction Type of confirmed order and special deposits, the data will be reviewed to recognize excellent staff performance at the end of the month.</i></br>
2/ Relationship of Customer <--> Building</br>
<i>When customers are consulted and confirm a building, a Contract will be initiated with that building.
The contract will have various types such as "Purchase/Rent," payment status of "Full Payment," "Installment," and will include some terms (Contract Terms) like usage regulations, return policies, building insurance, and contract cancellation policies for both brokers and customers.
Customers who have "confirmed" or initiated a contract with the building have the right to review the building.</i></br>
3/ Relationship of User <--> Building</br>
<i>ADMIN/MANAGER coordinates the staff working with a building so that there is always one person managing the entire building and all customer services for that building.</i></br>
4/ Attributes revolving around the Building</br>
<i>RentArea: A building will have many areas for rent (or purchase).
District: A building may only be located in one district (if a building spans land in two districts, then it should be considered as being in the district with more land area).
BuildingType: Buildings could be residential houses, furnished houses, commercial buildings, service apartments, or high-end apartments.
